## Key Benefits and Advantages
### ‚öí Data Modelling without coding
Whether you're dealing with web apps, mobile apps or client application, just forget about all data management effort. All you will need with RawCMS is to define your data structure and relationships, using a simple and intuitive UI. Simply say stop to the boring repetitive code!

### üéõ Agnostic and Universal Framework for your Data
Due to the API approach, RawCMS is very flexible and adapts perfectly to all use cases. Using GraphQL or REST standard RawCMS can be used by everybody without any headhaches. This gives you a solid and modern foundation for your project. 

### üöÄ Ready to use
Built on top of the well-known .net core framework, RawCMS can be deployed on every platforms in a click. No longer are there concerns about OS licenses or portability, just run it.
Benefit from all existing Symfony Components and Bundles provided by the community, or create your own Bundles to extend projects with reusable components. 

### üíé Your backend consolidated in one Platform
No more point-to-point integration, multiple tools, or expenses. You can consolidate Log Collecting, Api Gateway, Translation, Session Storage and CMS in one, simple, free platform.

### ‚ú®Ô∏è Modern and Intuitive Architecture
We love quality software design and aim to help others on building wonderful applications! Using RawCMS you will keep you architecture clean and efficient.

## Architectural Prospective

With RawCMs you have a central platform that manages most critical services, making them a commodity. You only have to focus on the UI development and on implementation of business logins. No more stress on deploying services or selecting online tools. You simply have a well-kept, and free, Content Management System.

Use RawCms brings to a clean and easy to manage infrastructure, compared to the traditional design. You have a meshed connected system, with multiple services that talks together. The old style approach is hard to mantain and costly.

The resulting program is possible thanks to the modular and scalable RawCMS architecture. See the key points:

1. **Modular**: Each module is shipped in a NuGet package that can be added to the system to gain new features
2. **Headless**: RawCMS doesn't include any presentation logic. All presentation is delegated to the caller. This aims to create a scalable and reusable system
3. **Packaged**: RawCMS must be shipped into a single deployable package or added into an existent ASP.NET Core application as a NuGet package.
4. **Extensible**: RawCMS must be customized by the user through extension only. So no changes to the code will be done, just adding new packages.
5. **Buildless**: RawCMS must give the possibility to manage an installation without the need to manage a codebase or a code repository. It will be possible to add lambdas code at runtime.
6. **Caller Friendly**: Produce data in many formats to help integration (Odata, GraphQL)

## Preview and Demo

### Data Modeling
Data modeling is based off a simple UI that allows for flexible field definition and relational table in a single click.
